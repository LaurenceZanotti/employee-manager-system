Sure, here's a sample project requirements that exercises Java concepts like OOP, Inheritance, Exception Handling, and Data Persistence:

## Project Title
Employee Management System

## Project Description

The Employee Management System is a console-based application that manages employees' records for a company. The application will allow administrators to create, read, update, and delete employee records.

## Functional Requirements

- The system should allow administrators to create a new employee record by providing the following details: employee name, age, gender, designation, department, and salary.
- The system should allow administrators to read the existing employee records by providing the employee ID.
- The system should allow administrators to update an existing employee record by providing the employee ID and the details to be updated.
- The system should allow administrators to delete an existing employee record by providing the employee ID.
- The system should validate the user inputs and provide appropriate error messages in case of invalid inputs.
- The system should store employee records in a database to ensure data persistence.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- The application should follow Object-Oriented Programming principles and implement Inheritance where applicable.
- The application should handle Exceptions appropriately and provide meaningful error messages to the user.
- The application should use a database for data persistence and use JDBC API to interact with the database.
- The application should have a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for administrators to use the application.

## Technology Stack

- Java 8 or later
- JDBC API for database connectivity
- MySQL database
- Eclipse IDE

## Deliverables

- Source code for the Employee Management System project.
- A document that explains the project's requirements, design, and implementation details.
- A video demonstration of the application's functionality.

> Note: You can modify the project requirements as per your requirements and add additional features or functionality.
